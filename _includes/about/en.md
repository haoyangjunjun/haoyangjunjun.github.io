Hello, I am Haoyangjunjun, a beginner currently in my junior year studying Information Security at [Hebei Finance University](https://www.hbfu.edu.cn/). I enjoy staying up late and coding.
<br>
I'm not standoffish, just a bit socially awkward. I hope to contribute to excellent open-source projects in the future.
<br>
Currently, I am familiar with Python and C, have experience in deploying Django projects, have used Vue front-end framework, am familiar with SQL databases, have scraped data using web crawlers, possess basic operating skills in Kali Linux, am proficient in using some penetration testing tools, have worked with Arduino, have developed an app using HBuilderX, am familiar with GitHub, have passed CET-6 (College English Test Band 6), possess basic skills in Blender modeling and rendering, and am capable of video editing, photo retouching, and computer repair.
<br>
> Okay, I know too little and don't know too much. It took me a long time to come up with such a pitiful amount. I'm not proficient in any skill. There's no end to learning. I'll update this when I've learned more in the future!
